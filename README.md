# Summary 

I have a Linux Server setup on an Acer Chromebook R11 laptop with a CasaOS interface that can be used and accessed on the Local Area Network. 
The server's IP address is statically allocated through the modem website (through DHCP configuration.) The homelab allows me to do a variety of tasks from configuring
two-factor authentication on multiple devices registered through the interface to creating and managing a database and its infromation.
